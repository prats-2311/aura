# Quick Test Guide: Explain Selected Text Feature

## ‚úÖ AURA is Ready!

The performance monitoring system has been successfully integrated and AURA is ready to test.

## üöÄ How to Test the Explain Selected Text Feature

### Step 1: Start AURA

```bash
# Make sure you're in the aura conda environment
conda activate aura

# Start AURA with performance monitoring
python main.py --performance
```

### Step 2: Test Voice Commands

#### Basic Commands to Try:

1. **"Computer, explain this"** ‚Üê Primary command
2. **"Computer, what does this mean?"**
3. **"Computer, explain the selected text"**
4. **"Computer, tell me about this"**
5. **"Computer, define this"**

#### For Code:

- **"Computer, explain this code"**
- **"Computer, what does this function do?"**

### Step 3: Testing Process

1. **Open any application** (Safari, Chrome, TextEdit, VS Code, etc.)
2. **Select/highlight text** with your mouse (make sure it's blue/highlighted)
3. **Say the wake word**: "Computer"
4. **Wait for the beep** (indicates AURA is listening)
5. **Give your command**: "Explain this"
6. **Listen for the explanation**

### Step 4: Test Different Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Web Article

- Open Safari/Chrome ‚Üí Go to Wikipedia or news site
- Select a paragraph ‚Üí Say: "Computer, what does this mean?"

#### Scenario 2: Code Snippet

- Open VS Code ‚Üí Select a function
- Say: "Computer, explain this code"

#### Scenario 3: PDF Document

- Open a PDF in Preview ‚Üí Select text
- Say: "Computer, explain the selected text"

## üìä Performance Monitoring (NEW!)

The system now automatically tracks:

- **Text capture speed** (target: < 500ms)
- **Explanation generation time** (target: < 5 seconds)
- **Success rates** (target: > 95%)
- **Cache effectiveness** (improves with repeated use)

### View Live Performance Stats:

```bash
# In a separate terminal while AURA is running
python -c "
from modules.performance_monitor import get_performance_monitor
monitor = get_performance_monitor()
summary = monitor.get_performance_summary()
print(f'Operations: {summary.get(\"total_operations\", 0)}')
print(f'Success Rate: {summary.get(\"success_rate\", 0):.1%}')
print(f'Average Speed: {summary.get(\"avg_duration_ms\", 0):.1f}ms')
"
```

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

### Good Performance:

- **Immediate response**: Thinking sound plays right away
- **Fast text capture**: < 500ms
- **Quick explanation**: Total response < 5 seconds
- **High success rate**: Works 95%+ of the time
- **Caching benefits**: Repeated similar text is faster

### What You'll Hear:

1. **"Computer"** ‚Üí Beep sound (AURA is listening)
2. **"Explain this"** ‚Üí Brief thinking sound
3. **Processing** ‚Üí AURA captures selected text
4. **Explanation** ‚Üí Clear spoken explanation
5. **Ready** ‚Üí AURA is ready for next command

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "No text selected" Error:

- Make sure text is highlighted (blue/selected)
- Try selecting text again
- Check accessibility permissions

### Slow Response:

- Check internet connection
- Try shorter text selections
- Monitor performance logs

### Permission Issues:

- Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility**
- Add **Terminal.app** (or your IDE)
- Restart AURA
