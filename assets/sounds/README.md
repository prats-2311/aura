# AURA Sound Assets

This directory contains audio files used for system feedback:

- `success.wav` - Pleasant ascending chord (C major) played when a task completes successfully
- `failure.wav` - Descending minor chord with downward sweep played when an error occurs
- `thinking.wav` - Gentle pulsing tone played when AURA is processing a command

## Audio Specifications

- **Format**: WAV (RIFF) files
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit
- **Channels**: Mono
- **Duration**: 1.2-2.0 seconds for optimal feedback timing

## Audio Design

### Success Sound

- **Frequencies**: C major chord (261.63 Hz, 329.63 Hz, 392.00 Hz)
- **Duration**: 1.2 seconds
- **Character**: Pleasant, uplifting, with exponential decay envelope
- **Use**: Task completion, successful operations

### Failure Sound

- **Frequencies**: A minor chord (220.00 Hz, 261.63 Hz, 311.13 Hz) with downward sweep (300-150 Hz)
- **Duration**: 1.5 seconds
- **Character**: Gentle but clear indication of failure, not harsh or alarming
- **Use**: Error conditions, failed operations

### Thinking Sound

- **Frequency**: 440 Hz (A4) with 5 Hz modulation and 3 Hz pulsing
- **Duration**: 2.0 seconds
- **Character**: Gentle, contemplative pulsing with slow decay
- **Use**: Processing indicators, analysis in progress

## Integration

These audio files are automatically loaded by the FeedbackModule and used throughout the AURA system for:

- Conversational feedback enhancement
- Deferred action workflow audio cues
- GUI interaction success/failure feedback
- System status notifications

The files are designed to be pleasant and non-intrusive while providing clear audio feedback for different system states.
