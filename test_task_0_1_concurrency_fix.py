Test script for Task 0.1: Fix Concurrency Deadlock in Deferred Actions

This test verifies that the concurrency deadlock fix works properly by:
1. Starting a deferred action that enters waiting state
2. Issuing a new command while the deferred action is waiting
3. Verifying that the new command can be processed without deadlock
4. Ensuring proper lock management throughout the process
