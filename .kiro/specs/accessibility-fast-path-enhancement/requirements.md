# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AURA Accessibility Fast Path Enhancement addresses critical performance issues in the current accessibility module where valid GUI commands like "Click on the Gmail link" fail to execute via the fast path and unnecessarily fall back to the slower vision-based workflow. This enhancement will make the AccessibilityModule more robust and intelligent by implementing broader element role detection, multi-attribute text searching, and fuzzy string matching to significantly improve command success rates and system performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to successfully detect clickable elements of all types (buttons, links, menu items, etc.), so that my commands execute quickly via the fast path instead of falling back to the slower vision workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the accessibility module searches for elements THEN it SHALL check for all clickable element roles including AXButton, AXLink, AXMenuItem, AXCheckBox, and AXRadioButton
2. WHEN an element matches any clickable role THEN the system SHALL proceed to text matching validation
3. IF an element has a clickable role THEN the system SHALL not skip it based on role type alone
4. WHEN searching for elements THEN the system SHALL maintain a configurable list of clickable roles for easy extension

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to find elements even when their accessibility labels differ from the visible text, so that commands like "Click Gmail" work even when the accessibility label is "Google Mail".

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking element text content THEN the system SHALL examine multiple accessibility attributes in priority order: AXTitle, AXDescription, AXValue
2. WHEN an attribute contains matching text THEN the system SHALL return that element as a successful match
3. IF the primary attribute (AXTitle) doesn't match THEN the system SHALL check secondary attributes before failing
4. WHEN multiple attributes are available THEN the system SHALL use the first successful match found

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to handle minor text variations and typos in my commands, so that "Sign In" matches "Sign-In button" and similar variations work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing user command text to element text THEN the system SHALL use fuzzy string matching instead of exact matching
2. WHEN fuzzy matching is performed THEN the system SHALL use a confidence threshold of at least 85% to prevent false positives
3. IF the fuzzy match score exceeds the threshold THEN the system SHALL consider it a valid match
4. WHEN fuzzy matching fails to find matches THEN the system SHALL fall back to the existing vision workflow
5. WHEN fuzzy matching is used THEN the system SHALL log the match score for debugging purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to intelligently extract the target element name from my natural language commands, so that "Click on the Gmail link" correctly identifies "gmail link" as the target.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a user command THEN the orchestrator SHALL extract the target entity by removing action words and articles
2. WHEN extracting targets THEN the system SHALL remove common action words like "click", "type", "press"
3. WHEN extracting targets THEN the system SHALL remove common articles like "the", "on", "a", "an"
4. WHEN the target is extracted THEN it SHALL be passed to the accessibility module for element matching
5. IF target extraction fails THEN the system SHALL use the full command text as fallback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the enhanced accessibility module to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing functionality continues to work while new features are added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced module is deployed THEN all existing accessibility functionality SHALL continue to work unchanged
2. WHEN new fuzzy matching fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to existing exact matching behavior
3. WHEN new role detection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to existing button-only detection
4. IF the fuzzy matching library is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to exact matching
5. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for all new parameters

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the accessibility enhancements to be configurable, so that matching thresholds and behavior can be tuned for different environments and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load fuzzy matching confidence threshold from configuration
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load the list of clickable roles from configuration
3. WHEN configuration values are invalid THEN the system SHALL use default values and log warnings
4. IF configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL apply new settings without restart where possible
5. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log detailed matching information and scores

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the enhanced fast path to complete commands in under 2 seconds, so that the system feels responsive and efficient compared to the vision-based fallback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command uses the enhanced fast path THEN it SHALL complete element detection within 1 second
2. WHEN fuzzy matching is performed THEN it SHALL not add more than 200ms to processing time
3. WHEN multiple attributes are checked THEN the total attribute checking SHALL complete within 500ms
4. IF the fast path exceeds 2 seconds total THEN the system SHALL log a performance warning
5. WHEN performance targets are met THEN the system SHALL avoid falling back to vision workflow

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want comprehensive logging and metrics for the accessibility enhancements, so that I can verify correct operation and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN element matching is performed THEN the system SHALL log the roles checked and attributes examined
2. WHEN fuzzy matching is used THEN the system SHALL log the match scores and threshold comparisons
3. WHEN the fast path succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the successful match details and timing
4. WHEN the fast path fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and fallback trigger
5. WHEN debugging mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging for all matching steps
