# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive system stabilization and refactoring plan for AURA that addresses critical bugs, improves architecture maintainability, and enhances system reliability. The plan follows a phased approach starting with proactive refactoring of the monolithic Orchestrator class, followed by systematic bug fixes, and concluding with foundational architecture improvements to support advanced features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Orchestrator Refactoring for Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Orchestrator class to be refactored from a monolithic "god object" into a clean, modular architecture with separated concerns, so that future bug fixes and feature implementations are simpler, safer, and easier to debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is refactored THEN a new `handlers/` directory SHALL be created with proper module structure
2. WHEN handler classes are created THEN they SHALL inherit from a common `BaseHandler` abstract base class with a standardized `handle()` method
3. WHEN GUI interaction logic is migrated THEN it SHALL be moved from `Orchestrator._execute_command_internal` to `GUIHandler.handle()` method
4. WHEN conversational logic is prepared THEN a `ConversationHandler` class SHALL be created for future conversational features
5. WHEN deferred action logic is migrated THEN it SHALL be moved to a dedicated `DeferredActionHandler` class
6. WHEN the Orchestrator is simplified THEN its primary role SHALL be state management and command routing via intent recognition
7. WHEN routing is implemented THEN the Orchestrator SHALL instantiate appropriate handlers and delegate command processing to their `handle()` methods

### Requirement 2: Concurrency Deadlock Resolution

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to handle concurrent commands and deferred actions without hanging or becoming unresponsive, so that I can interrupt operations and issue new commands reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deferred action returns status 'waiting_for_user_action' THEN the Orchestrator SHALL release the execution lock immediately
2. WHEN `_on_deferred_action_trigger` is called THEN it SHALL re-acquire the execution lock before executing the final action
3. WHEN deferred action execution completes THEN the execution lock SHALL be released properly
4. WHEN a new command is issued during a deferred action wait state THEN the system SHALL process it without hanging
5. WHEN concurrent deferred actions are attempted THEN the second command SHALL process while the first waits for user input

### Requirement 3: Deferred Action Content Quality

**User Story:** As a user, I want generated content from deferred actions to be properly formatted, complete, and free from duplicates or unwanted prefixes, so that the content I receive is ready to use without manual cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content generation prompts are used THEN they SHALL explicitly request proper indentation, formatting, and structure
2. WHEN generated content is processed THEN the system SHALL remove unwanted prefixes like "Here is the code:" and markdown code blocks
3. WHEN single-line code is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to reformat it with proper newlines and indentation
4. WHEN deferred actions execute THEN they SHALL not be constrained by short top-level timeouts that interrupt long typing processes
5. WHEN content is typed THEN it SHALL maintain proper formatting including indentation and line breaks

### Requirement 4: GUI Interaction Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic GUI commands like click and scroll to work reliably across different applications, so that AURA's core automation functionality is dependable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application detection fails THEN the system SHALL use AppleScript fallback to identify the focused application
2. WHEN scroll commands are executed THEN the system SHALL identify and focus the primary scrollable area before scrolling
3. WHEN no specific scrollable area is found THEN the system SHALL fall back to current scroll behavior
4. WHEN GUI interactions fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
5. WHEN application context is needed THEN the system SHALL reliably determine the active application without "No focused application found" errors

### Requirement 5: Intent Recognition and Smart Routing

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to intelligently understand different types of commands and route them appropriately, so that conversational queries, GUI interactions, and content generation requests are handled by specialized logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any command is received THEN the system SHALL use LLM-based intent recognition to classify it into categories
2. WHEN intent categories are defined THEN they SHALL include 'gui_interaction', 'conversational_chat', 'deferred_action', and 'question_answering'
3. WHEN intent is recognized THEN the Orchestrator SHALL route commands to appropriate handler methods
4. WHEN intent recognition fails THEN the system SHALL default to GUI interaction as a safe fallback
5. WHEN routing is implemented THEN existing GUI automation logic SHALL be preserved in the new `_handle_gui_interaction` method

### Requirement 6: Audio Responsiveness Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to respond more quickly to voice commands by detecting silence automatically, so that I don't have to wait through fixed recording delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN speech-to-text recording starts THEN the system SHALL record in chunks rather than fixed durations
2. WHEN silence is detected during recording THEN the system SHALL automatically stop recording and process the audio
3. WHEN silence detection is implemented THEN it SHALL significantly reduce the current 8-second recording delay
4. WHEN audio processing completes THEN the user SHALL experience faster, more responsive interactions
5. WHEN silence detection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to the current fixed-duration recording method

### Requirement 7: Content Comprehension Fast Path

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to quickly summarize and understand content from web pages and PDFs without relying on slow vision-based analysis, so that content queries are fast and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser content is requested THEN the system SHALL extract text using AppleScript and JavaScript before falling back to vision
2. WHEN PDF content is requested THEN the system SHALL extract text using command-line tools like `pdftotext`
3. WHEN application detection is performed THEN it SHALL recognize PDF reader applications by bundle ID
4. WHEN the `answer_question` method is called THEN it SHALL use text-based fast path for browsers and PDFs before vision fallback
5. WHEN fast path content extraction fails THEN the system SHALL seamlessly fall back to vision-based analysis

### Requirement 8: Conversational Chat Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have natural conversations with AURA about general topics beyond GUI automation, so that it functions as a comprehensive AI assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversational queries are detected THEN they SHALL be routed to a dedicated conversation handler
2. WHEN conversational prompts are defined THEN they SHALL establish AURA's chat personality and response style
3. WHEN conversational responses are generated THEN they SHALL be spoken to the user using the audio system
4. WHEN conversations complete THEN the system SHALL return to ready state for new commands
5. WHEN conversational features are implemented THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with the intent-based routing system

### Requirement 9: System Stability and Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to recover gracefully from errors and maintain system stability even when individual components fail, so that temporary issues don't require system restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
2. WHEN recoverable errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery before failing
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully without corrupting system state
4. WHEN error recovery is attempted THEN it SHALL not interfere with ongoing operations
5. WHEN system health is monitored THEN it SHALL provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility Preservation

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want all current AURA functionality to continue working exactly as before during and after the refactoring, so that my existing workflows remain uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing commands are used THEN they SHALL produce identical results to the pre-refactoring system
2. WHEN GUI automation is performed THEN it SHALL use the same underlying logic, just organized in handler classes
3. WHEN question answering is requested THEN it SHALL maintain existing functionality while adding fast path optimizations
4. WHEN audio feedback is provided THEN it SHALL maintain the same user experience and timing
5. WHEN any existing feature is accessed THEN the user SHALL not notice any behavioral changes except improved performance and reliability
