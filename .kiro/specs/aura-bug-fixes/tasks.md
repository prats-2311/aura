# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix text formatting in cliclick typing method

  - Modify `_cliclick_type()` method to handle newlines and special characters properly
  - Add text preprocessing to escape characters correctly for cliclick
  - Test with multi-line code examples to ensure formatting preservation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 2. Fix text formatting in AppleScript typing method

  - Enhance `_macos_type()` method to preserve indentation andnicode: caf, nave, rsumSpecial characters test:
  - Quotes: "double" and 'single'
  - Backslashes: \ and \n and \tab- Symbols: @#$%^&\*()[]{}
  - Unicode: cafa, naave, rasuma line structure
  - Improve newline handling and character escaping for AppleScript
  - Add debugging logs to track formatting preservation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement typing method fallback with formatting validation

  - Add formatting validation after typing attempts
  - Implement automatic fallback when formatting is not preserved
  - Create comprehensive test cases for different content types
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 4.1_

- [ ] 4. Enhance intent recognition for typing commands

  - Update `_fallback_intent_classification()` to better detect typing patterns
  - Add specific patterns for "type, [text]" command format
  - Improve confidence scoring for simple typing commands
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 5. Fix fast path routing for simple commands

  - Modify intent recognition to prioritize gui_interaction for typing commands
  - Add validation to prevent simple typing commands from going to LLM
  - Test routing accuracy with various typing command formats
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 6. Implement content length management in reasoning module

  - Add configurable prompt length limits to `process_query()` method
  - Implement intelligent content truncation for large inputs
  - Add proper error handling for oversized content
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Add intelligent content chunking for large documents

  - Create `_chunk_content_intelligently()` method for smart content segmentation
  - Implement section prioritization for web pages and PDFs
  - Add overlap handling to maintain context between chunks
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Enhance error handling and user feedback

  - Improve error messages for content processing failures
  - Add fallback responses when summarization fails due to length
  - Implement detailed logging for debugging all three bug scenarios
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 3.6, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 9. Create comprehensive test suite for bug fixes

  - Write unit tests for text formatting preservation
  - Create integration tests for intent recognition routing
  - Add tests for large content processing and chunking
  - Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ] 10. Validate fixes with real-world scenarios
  - Test with actual code generation and typing scenarios
  - Validate "type, [name]" command routing
  - Test "what's on my screen" with large PDF and web content
  - Verify user experience improvements and performance impact
  - _Requirements: End-to-end validation of all fixes_
