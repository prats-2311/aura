# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create QuestionAnsweringHandler foundation

  - Create new `handlers/question_answering_handler.py` file with QuestionAnsweringHandler class inheriting from BaseHandler
  - Implement basic `handle()` method structure with command validation and execution timing
  - Add initialization method that accepts orchestrator reference and sets up logging
  - Create placeholder methods for `_try_fast_path()`, `_extract_browser_content()`, `_extract_pdf_content()`, and `_fallback_to_vision()`
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Implement application detection integration

  - Add method `_detect_active_application()` that uses ApplicationDetector to get current app info
  - Implement `_is_supported_application()` method to check if app is browser or PDF reader
  - Create `_get_extraction_method()` method that returns appropriate extraction strategy based on app type
  - Add error handling for application detection failures with fallback to vision processing
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 3. Implement browser content extraction

  - Create `_extract_browser_content()` method that uses BrowserAccessibilityHandler
  - Add browser type detection and call appropriate `get_page_text_content()` method
  - Implement content validation to ensure extracted text is substantial (>50 characters)
  - Add timeout handling (2 second limit) and error recovery for browser extraction failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 4. Implement PDF content extraction

  - Create `_extract_pdf_content()` method that uses PDFHandler
  - Add PDF application detection and call `extract_text_from_open_document()` method
  - Implement content validation and cleaning for extracted PDF text
  - Add timeout handling (2 second limit) and error recovery for PDF extraction failures
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 5. Implement fast path orchestration logic

  - Create `_try_fast_path()` method that coordinates application detection and content extraction
  - Add logic to determine extraction method based on application type (browser vs PDF)
  - Implement content processing pipeline: extract → validate → summarize → respond
  - Add performance monitoring to track fast path execution time and success rates
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.5, 2.1, 2.5, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Implement text summarization integration

  - Add `_summarize_content()` method that sends extracted text to ReasoningModule
  - Implement content length management to handle large text extractions (limit to 50KB)
  - Add summarization timeout handling (3 second limit) and fallback to raw text if needed
  - Create response formatting that speaks the summarized content using AudioModule
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 7. Implement vision fallback mechanism

  - Create `_fallback_to_vision()` method that calls existing vision-based question answering
  - Add seamless transition logic that maintains identical user experience to current implementation
  - Implement fallback triggering for: unsupported apps, extraction failures, and timeout scenarios
  - Add logging to track fallback reasons and frequency for monitoring
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 8. Update orchestrator intent routing

  - Modify `_get_handler_for_intent()` method in orchestrator.py to route 'question_answering' intent to QuestionAnsweringHandler
  - Remove question answering logic from existing `answer_question()` method in orchestrator
  - Update handler initialization in `_initialize_handlers()` to include QuestionAnsweringHandler
  - Add error handling for QuestionAnsweringHandler initialization failures with fallback to existing logic
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 9. Update intent recognition configuration

  - Modify intent recognition prompt in config.py to properly classify question answering requests
  - Add 'question_answering' intent type to valid intents list in orchestrator
  - Update fallback intent classification to better detect question patterns
  - Test intent recognition accuracy for "what's on my screen" type commands
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive test suite

  - Write unit tests in `tests/test_question_answering_handler.py` for all handler methods
  - Create integration tests in `tests/test_fast_path_integration.py` for end-to-end scenarios
  - Implement browser-specific tests for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox content extraction
  - Add PDF extraction tests for Preview.app and Adobe Reader applications
  - Write performance tests to validate <5 second response time requirement
  - Create backward compatibility tests to ensure existing functionality is preserved
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 11. Add performance monitoring and logging

  - Implement performance metrics collection for fast path success rates and timing
  - Add detailed logging for extraction methods, content sizes, and fallback reasons
  - Create health check validation for browser and PDF handler availability
  - Add monitoring for overall system performance impact of fast path implementation
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 5.5_

- [ ] 12. Integration testing and validation
  - Test complete workflow with real browser applications (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
  - Test complete workflow with real PDF applications (Preview, Adobe Reader)
  - Validate fallback behavior when applications are not detected or extraction fails
  - Perform end-to-end performance validation to ensure <5 second response times
  - Test backward compatibility with existing question answering commands
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_
