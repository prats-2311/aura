# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Content Comprehension Fast Path feature aims to dramatically improve the performance of "what's on my screen" commands by implementing a fast, non-vision-based summarization system for web browsers and PDFs. Currently, these commands are routed incorrectly to the GUIHandler and rely on slow vision-based processing, creating a poor user experience. This feature will create a dedicated question answering handler and integrate existing browser and PDF text extraction capabilities to provide near-instantaneous responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user asking "what's on my screen" while viewing a web page, I want to receive a fast text-based summary instead of waiting for slow vision processing, so that I can quickly understand the content without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question about screen content AND the active application is a browser THEN the system SHALL extract text content using browser accessibility APIs
2. WHEN text content is successfully extracted from a browser THEN the system SHALL send the text to the reasoning module for summarization within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the reasoning module completes summarization THEN the system SHALL speak the result to the user
4. IF browser text extraction fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to the existing vision-based approach
5. WHEN using the fast path THEN the system SHALL complete the entire process in under 5 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user asking "what's on my screen" while viewing a PDF document, I want to receive a fast text-based summary of the PDF content, so that I can understand the document without waiting for vision processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question about screen content AND the active application is a PDF reader THEN the system SHALL extract text content using PDF handling capabilities
2. WHEN text content is successfully extracted from a PDF THEN the system SHALL send the text to the reasoning module for summarization within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the reasoning module completes summarization THEN the system SHALL speak the result to the user
4. IF PDF text extraction fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to the existing vision-based approach
5. WHEN using the fast path THEN the system SHALL complete the entire process in under 5 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want question answering logic to be handled by a dedicated handler instead of the GUI handler, so that the code is properly organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a 'question_answering' intent THEN it SHALL route the request to a dedicated QuestionAnsweringHandler
2. WHEN the QuestionAnsweringHandler is created THEN it SHALL inherit from BaseHandler
3. WHEN the QuestionAnsweringHandler processes a request THEN it SHALL implement the fast path logic before falling back to vision
4. WHEN the orchestrator routes intents THEN it SHALL no longer send question answering requests to the GUIHandler
5. WHEN the new handler is integrated THEN all existing question answering functionality SHALL continue to work without regression

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want the application detection to work reliably to determine when I'm using a browser or PDF reader, so that the fast path can be activated appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs to determine the active application THEN it SHALL use the ApplicationDetector module
2. WHEN the ApplicationDetector identifies a browser application THEN it SHALL return 'browser' as the application type
3. WHEN the ApplicationDetector identifies a PDF reader application THEN it SHALL return 'pdf_reader' as the application type
4. WHEN the application type is neither browser nor PDF reader THEN the system SHALL proceed with the vision-based fallback
5. WHEN application detection fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and proceed with the vision-based fallback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain backward compatibility with existing question answering functionality, so that my current workflows are not disrupted during the upgrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new fast path is implemented THEN all existing question answering commands SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN the fast path is not applicable THEN the system SHALL seamlessly fall back to the existing vision-based approach
3. WHEN the system falls back to vision processing THEN the user experience SHALL be identical to the current implementation
4. WHEN the new handler is deployed THEN no existing configuration or user commands SHALL require changes
5. WHEN errors occur in the fast path THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to the vision-based approach without user intervention
