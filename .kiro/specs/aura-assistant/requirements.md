# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AURA (Autonomous User-side Robotic Assistant) is a hybrid perception-reasoning AI system that enables users to control their desktop computer through natural voice commands. The system combines local vision models for screen understanding with cloud-based reasoning models for action planning, creating an intelligent assistant that can perform complex desktop automation tasks through conversational interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to activate AURA using a wake word, so that I can initiate voice-controlled desktop automation without manual interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user says the configured wake word THEN the system SHALL activate and begin listening for commands
2. WHEN the wake word is detected THEN the system SHALL provide audio feedback to confirm activation
3. IF the wake word detection fails THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring without interruption
4. WHEN the system is activated THEN it SHALL capture the current screen state for context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to understand what's currently on my screen, so that it can make informed decisions about how to execute my commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AURA is activated THEN it SHALL capture a screenshot of the current desktop
2. WHEN a screenshot is captured THEN the system SHALL send it to a local vision model for analysis
3. WHEN the vision model processes the screen THEN it SHALL return a structured JSON description of interactive elements
4. IF the vision analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide error feedback and retry once
5. WHEN interactive elements are identified THEN the system SHALL include their coordinates and descriptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to give AURA natural language commands, so that I can control my computer conversationally without learning specific syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AURA is activated THEN it SHALL listen for voice input using speech-to-text
2. WHEN voice input is received THEN the system SHALL convert it to text accurately
3. WHEN text conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL send the command to the reasoning module
4. IF speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL ask the user to repeat the command
5. WHEN a command is processed THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about what action will be taken

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to create intelligent action plans based on my commands and screen context, so that complex tasks can be broken down into executable steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user command and screen context are available THEN the reasoning module SHALL generate an action plan
2. WHEN generating an action plan THEN the system SHALL use a cloud-based LLM for complex reasoning
3. WHEN an action plan is created THEN it SHALL be returned as a structured JSON with atomic steps
4. IF the reasoning model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error feedback
5. WHEN the action plan includes multiple steps THEN each step SHALL be clearly defined with required parameters

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to execute the planned actions on my desktop, so that my commands are carried out automatically without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an action plan is received THEN the automation module SHALL execute each step sequentially
2. WHEN executing click actions THEN the system SHALL move the cursor to specified coordinates and click
3. WHEN executing type actions THEN the system SHALL input the specified text at the current cursor position
4. WHEN executing scroll actions THEN the system SHALL scroll in the specified direction and amount
5. IF any action fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining actions
6. WHEN all actions are complete THEN the system SHALL provide completion feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to provide audio feedback during operation, so that I understand what the system is doing and when tasks are complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AURA begins processing THEN it SHALL play a "thinking" sound to indicate activity
2. WHEN a task completes successfully THEN the system SHALL play a success sound
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL play a failure sound
4. WHEN AURA needs to communicate information THEN it SHALL use text-to-speech
5. WHEN providing spoken feedback THEN the audio SHALL be clear and at appropriate volume

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to handle web form filling tasks, so that I can complete online forms through voice commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests form filling THEN the system SHALL identify form fields on the current page
2. WHEN form fields are identified THEN the system SHALL create a sequence of click and type actions
3. WHEN filling forms THEN the system SHALL handle different input types (text, dropdowns, checkboxes)
4. IF form validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt to correct them
5. WHEN form filling is complete THEN the system SHALL confirm completion with the user

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to answer questions about what's on my screen, so that I can get information without having to read everything myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question about screen content THEN the system SHALL analyze the current screen
2. WHEN analyzing for information THEN the system SHALL extract relevant text and data
3. WHEN information is found THEN the system SHALL provide a spoken answer
4. IF the requested information is not visible THEN the system SHALL inform the user
5. WHEN answering questions THEN the response SHALL be concise and relevant

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want AURA to be configurable through a central configuration file, so that I can easily manage API keys, model settings, and other parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from a central config file
2. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN all modules SHALL use the centralized settings
3. WHEN API endpoints change THEN only the config file SHALL need updating
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN models are updated THEN the config SHALL allow easy model name changes

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AURA to have a modular architecture, so that individual components can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is designed THEN each major function SHALL be in a separate module
2. WHEN modules interact THEN they SHALL use well-defined interfaces
3. WHEN testing individual modules THEN they SHALL be testable in isolation
4. IF one module fails THEN other modules SHALL continue functioning where possible
5. WHEN adding new features THEN the modular design SHALL support easy extension
