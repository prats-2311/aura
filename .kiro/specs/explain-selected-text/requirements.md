# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The "Explain Selected Text" feature enables AURA to understand and provide explanations for text that users have manually selected in any macOS-supported application. This feature enhances AURA's accessibility and utility by allowing users to get instant explanations of highlighted content through voice commands, supporting a wide range of applications including web browsers, PDF readers, text editors, and code editors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select text in any application and ask AURA to explain it, so that I can quickly understand complex content without switching contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text in any macOS application AND issues a voice command like "explain this" or "explain the selected text" THEN AURA SHALL capture the selected text and provide a spoken explanation
2. WHEN the user issues an explanation command AND no text is currently selected THEN AURA SHALL inform the user that no text was found and request them to select text first
3. WHEN text is selected in web browsers (Chrome, Safari) THEN AURA SHALL successfully capture and explain the selected content
4. WHEN text is selected in PDF readers (Preview) THEN AURA SHALL successfully capture and explain the selected content
5. WHEN text is selected in text editors (TextEdit, VS Code) THEN AURA SHALL successfully capture and explain the selected content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to reliably capture selected text across different applications, so that the feature works consistently regardless of the application's accessibility support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the primary accessibility API method fails to capture selected text THEN AURA SHALL automatically fall back to a clipboard-based capture method
2. WHEN using the clipboard fallback method THEN AURA SHALL preserve the user's original clipboard content without disruption
3. WHEN text capture fails through both methods THEN AURA SHALL provide clear feedback about the failure and suggest alternative approaches
4. WHEN selected text contains special characters, formatting, or non-English content THEN AURA SHALL capture and process it correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to provide clear and contextually appropriate explanations, so that I can understand the selected content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN explaining general text content THEN AURA SHALL provide explanations in simple, accessible language
2. WHEN explaining code snippets THEN AURA SHALL explain what the code does and its purpose
3. WHEN explaining technical terms or jargon THEN AURA SHALL provide definitions and context
4. WHEN the selected text is very long THEN AURA SHALL provide a concise summary rather than an overly detailed explanation
5. WHEN the explanation generation fails THEN AURA SHALL provide clear error feedback and suggest retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the explain selected text feature to integrate seamlessly with AURA's existing voice interface, so that it feels like a natural part of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user issues an explanation command THEN AURA SHALL recognize it as an "explain_selected_text" intent through the existing intent recognition system
2. WHEN processing an explanation request THEN AURA SHALL provide audio feedback (thinking sound) to indicate processing has started
3. WHEN an explanation is successfully generated THEN AURA SHALL speak the explanation using the existing feedback module
4. WHEN an error occurs during explanation THEN AURA SHALL play the appropriate failure sound and provide spoken error feedback
5. WHEN the explanation is complete THEN AURA SHALL return to the ready state for new commands

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the explain selected text feature to be maintainable and extensible, so that it can be enhanced and debugged effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated ExplainSelectionHandler following the existing handler pattern
2. WHEN capturing selected text THEN the system SHALL implement both accessibility API and clipboard fallback methods as separate, testable functions
3. WHEN integrating with the orchestrator THEN the system SHALL follow existing patterns for intent recognition and handler routing
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate debug information for troubleshooting
5. WHEN the feature is complete THEN it SHALL include comprehensive test coverage for various applications and edge cases
