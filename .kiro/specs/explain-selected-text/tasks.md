# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up text capture infrastructure in AccessibilityModule

  - Add new method `get_selected_text_via_accessibility()` to AccessibilityModule that queries the focused element for AXSelectedText attribute
  - Implement error handling for cases where accessibility API is unavailable or element has no selected text
  - Add logging and performance tracking for accessibility-based text capture
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [ ] 2. Implement clipboard fallback method in AutomationModule

  - Add `pyperclip` dependency to requirements.txt for clipboard operations
  - Create `get_selected_text_via_clipboard()` method that preserves original clipboard, simulates Cmd+C, captures text, and restores clipboard
  - Implement robust error handling for clipboard access failures and permission issues
  - Add performance monitoring and logging for clipboard-based capture method
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Create unified text capture interface in AccessibilityModule

  - Implement main `get_selected_text()` method that tries accessibility API first, then falls back to clipboard method
  - Add comprehensive error handling that provides clear feedback for different failure scenarios
  - Implement performance logging to track success rates and timing for both capture methods
  - Create unit tests for text capture functionality with mocked accessibility and clipboard operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.2_

- [ ] 4. Update intent recognition system for explain selected text commands

  - Modify INTENT_RECOGNITION_PROMPT in config.py to include "explain_selected_text" intent category
  - Add pattern recognition for commands like "explain this", "explain the selected text", "what does this mean"
  - Test intent recognition with various explanation command variations to ensure proper classification
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 5.3_

- [ ] 5. Create ExplainSelectionHandler class

  - Create new file `handlers/explain_selection_handler.py` with ExplainSelectionHandler class inheriting from BaseHandler
  - Implement `handle()` method that captures selected text, generates explanation, and provides spoken feedback
  - Add comprehensive error handling for no text selected, capture failures, and explanation generation failures
  - Implement proper logging using BaseHandler's standardized logging methods
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.4_

- [ ] 6. Add explanation prompt template to configuration

  - Add EXPLAIN_TEXT_PROMPT constant to config.py with template for generating clear, contextual explanations
  - Include special handling instructions for code snippets, technical terms, and different content types
  - Design prompt to produce explanations in simple, accessible language suitable for spoken delivery
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Integrate ExplainSelectionHandler with orchestrator

  - Import ExplainSelectionHandler in orchestrator.py and initialize it in `_initialize_handlers()` method
  - Add "explain_selected_text" intent mapping in `_get_handler_for_intent()` method
  - Test handler integration with orchestrator's intent recognition and routing system
  - Verify proper error handling and fallback behavior when handler is unavailable
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.5, 5.3_

- [ ] 8. Implement explanation generation workflow

  - Integrate selected text capture with ReasoningModule for explanation generation
  - Add contextual prompt formatting that includes selected text and appropriate explanation instructions
  - Implement error handling for reasoning module failures, timeouts, and empty responses
  - Add validation to ensure explanation quality and appropriate length for spoken delivery
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5_

- [ ] 9. Add audio feedback and user interaction

  - Implement thinking sound playback when processing explanation requests
  - Add spoken delivery of explanations using FeedbackModule
  - Implement appropriate error feedback with failure sounds and clear error messages
  - Add success confirmation and return to ready state after explanation delivery
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive test suite for explain selected text feature

  - Write unit tests for text capture methods with various application scenarios
  - Create integration tests for handler workflow including intent recognition, text capture, and explanation generation
  - Implement edge case testing for no text selected, very long text, special characters, and different content types
  - Add performance tests to verify text capture speed and end-to-end explanation timing meets requirements
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 3.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 11. Test feature across different macOS applications

  - Test text selection and explanation in web browsers (Chrome, Safari) with various content types
  - Verify functionality in PDF readers (Preview) with formatted documents and technical content
  - Test in text editors (TextEdit, VS Code) with code snippets and plain text
  - Validate fallback behavior in applications with limited accessibility support
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 12. Optimize performance and add monitoring
  - Add performance metrics tracking for text capture timing and success rates
  - Implement caching strategies for repeated accessibility API calls
  - Add monitoring for explanation generation timing and quality
  - Create performance logging and alerting for operations that exceed target timing thresholds
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.5, 5.4, 5.5_
