# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a hybrid "Fast Path / Slow Path" architecture in AURA (Autonomous User-side Robotic Assistant) to drastically reduce latency for GUI automation tasks. The system will prioritize high-speed, non-visual element detection using macOS Accessibility APIs while maintaining fallback capabilities through the existing vision-based workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: High-Speed Accessibility API Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to respond to my GUI commands almost instantly for standard applications, so the interaction feels fluid and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user issues a GUI command (e.g., "click the 'File' menu") THEN the system SHALL first attempt to locate the element using the operating system's Accessibility API
2. IF the element is found via the Accessibility API THEN the system SHALL retrieve its coordinates and execute the action without capturing the screen or using the vision model
3. WHEN using the Accessibility API THEN the time from command recognition to action execution SHALL be less than 2 seconds
4. THE system SHALL be able to find elements in native macOS applications (like Finder, System Settings) and in major web browsers (like Safari or Chrome)
5. WHEN the Accessibility API is used THEN the system SHALL bypass the VisionModule and ReasoningModule entirely for performance

### Requirement 2: Vision Model Fallback System

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to still be able to control any application, even if it's non-standard or doesn't support accessibility features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the Accessibility API fails to find a requested element THEN the system SHALL automatically and seamlessly fall back to the existing vision-based workflow
2. WHEN falling back THEN the system SHALL capture a screenshot, send it to the local vision model, and proceed with the perception-reasoning loop as currently implemented
3. THE system SHALL provide subtle audio feedback to indicate it is using the more intensive visual analysis
4. WHEN falling back THEN the user experience SHALL remain consistent with current AURA functionality
5. THE fallback SHALL occur within 1 second of Accessibility API failure

### Requirement 3: Accessibility Module Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dedicated accessibility module that can efficiently query UI elements, so that the fast path can be reliably implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL include a new AccessibilityModule class in modules/accessibility.py
2. THE AccessibilityModule SHALL provide a find_element method that accepts role and label parameters
3. WHEN find_element is called THEN it SHALL return element coordinates and size if found, or None if not found
4. THE AccessibilityModule SHALL recursively traverse the accessibility tree of the active application
5. THE AccessibilityModule SHALL use pyobjc AppKit and Accessibility frameworks
6. THE AccessibilityModule SHALL handle accessibility API errors gracefully

### Requirement 4: Orchestrator Integration

**User Story:** As a system component, I want the orchestrator to intelligently choose between fast and slow paths, so that performance is optimized while maintaining reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Orchestrator SHALL be modified to use the hybrid model for GUI-related commands
2. WHEN executing GUI commands THEN the Orchestrator SHALL first attempt the AccessibilityModule fast path
3. IF fast path succeeds THEN the Orchestrator SHALL build a simple action plan and send it directly to AutomationModule
4. IF fast path fails THEN the Orchestrator SHALL proceed with the existing vision-based workflow
5. THE Orchestrator SHALL initialize and manage the AccessibilityModule instance
6. THE Orchestrator SHALL maintain performance metrics for both paths

### Requirement 5: Testing and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the hybrid system works correctly and provides expected performance benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL include unit tests for the AccessibilityModule in tests/test_accessibility.py
2. THE system SHALL include integration tests for hybrid orchestration in tests/test_hybrid_orchestration.py
3. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL verify that VisionModule is not called for fast path operations
4. THE tests SHALL cover both successful fast path and fallback scenarios
5. THE tests SHALL validate performance improvements for native applications
6. THE system SHALL include manual testing procedures for various application types

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand when AURA is using fast vs slow paths, so I can optimize my workflow and understand system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL log which path (fast or slow) is used for each GUI command
2. THE system SHALL track and report average response times for each path
3. THE system SHALL provide performance metrics through the existing performance dashboard
4. WHEN using different paths THEN the system SHALL provide distinct audio feedback
5. THE system SHALL maintain statistics on fast path success rates by application type
