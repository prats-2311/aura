# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances AURA (the AI assistant) with advanced conversational capabilities and deferred action support. The enhancement transforms AURA from a simple command classifier into an intelligent, stateful conversational agent that can handle multi-step interactions, generate content on demand, and seamlessly switch between different interaction modes including GUI automation, general conversation, and complex deferred actions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intent Recognition System

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to intelligently understand the type of request I'm making (GUI interaction, conversation, deferred action, or question), so that it can respond appropriately to different interaction styles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides any command THEN the system SHALL analyze the command using an LLM-based intent recognition system
2. WHEN intent recognition is performed THEN the system SHALL classify the intent into one of four categories: 'gui_interaction', 'conversational_chat', 'deferred_action', or 'question_answering'
3. IF intent recognition fails THEN the system SHALL default to 'gui_interaction' as a fallback
4. WHEN intent is recognized THEN the system SHALL route the command to the appropriate handler based on the classified intent

### Requirement 2: Conversational Chat Capability

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have natural conversations with AURA about general topics, so that I can interact with it like a helpful AI assistant beyond just GUI automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a conversational query THEN AURA SHALL respond in a friendly and helpful conversational tone
2. WHEN processing conversational queries THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated conversational prompt template
3. WHEN a conversational response is generated THEN AURA SHALL speak the response using the audio feedback system
4. WHEN conversational interaction completes THEN the system SHALL return to ready state for new commands

### Requirement 3: Deferred Action System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to request content generation (like code) and then specify where to place it by clicking, so that I can have AURA prepare content and place it precisely where I need it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a deferred action THEN the system SHALL generate the requested content using appropriate prompts
2. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL enter a waiting state and prompt the user to click where they want the content placed
3. WHEN in waiting state THEN the system SHALL start a global mouse listener to detect user clicks
4. WHEN the user clicks anywhere THEN the system SHALL execute the final action (typing the generated content) at the click location
5. WHEN the deferred action completes THEN the system SHALL reset to normal operation mode
6. IF a new command is received while waiting THEN the system SHALL cancel the deferred action and process the new command

### Requirement 4: State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to maintain proper state during multi-step interactions, so that it can handle complex workflows without getting confused or stuck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AURA is processing any command THEN it SHALL maintain appropriate state variables to track the current operation
2. WHEN in deferred action mode THEN the system SHALL track: waiting status, pending content, action type, and mouse listener state
3. WHEN state needs to be reset THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all state variables and stop any active listeners
4. WHEN a new command interrupts a waiting state THEN the system SHALL gracefully cancel the current operation and reset state

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Orchestrator Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the orchestrator to be refactored with proper separation of concerns, so that different interaction modes are handled cleanly and the system remains maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the orchestrator receives a command THEN it SHALL first perform intent recognition before any other processing
2. WHEN intent is determined THEN the orchestrator SHALL route to dedicated handler methods for each intent type
3. WHEN handling GUI interactions THEN the system SHALL preserve existing functionality while integrating with the new routing system
4. WHEN new handler methods are created THEN they SHALL follow consistent error handling and logging patterns

### Requirement 6: Global Mouse Listener Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to detect my mouse clicks globally across the system during deferred actions, so that I can specify target locations in any application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deferred action is initiated THEN the system SHALL start a global mouse listener that works across all applications
2. WHEN the mouse listener is active THEN it SHALL run in a separate daemon thread to avoid blocking the main application
3. WHEN a mouse click is detected THEN the listener SHALL trigger the callback and automatically stop listening
4. WHEN the mouse listener needs to be stopped THEN it SHALL clean up properly without leaving background processes

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Configuration Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want new prompt templates and configuration options to support the conversational features, so that the system behavior can be customized and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new prompts are needed THEN they SHALL be added to the configuration system with clear, descriptive names
2. WHEN intent recognition prompts are used THEN they SHALL provide clear instructions and expected JSON response formats
3. WHEN conversational prompts are used THEN they SHALL establish AURA's personality and response style
4. WHEN code generation prompts are used THEN they SHALL request high-quality, well-formatted output

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want all current AURA functionality to continue working exactly as before, so that the enhancement doesn't break my existing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing GUI automation commands are used THEN they SHALL work exactly as they did before the enhancement
2. WHEN the system defaults to GUI interaction mode THEN it SHALL use the existing command processing logic
3. WHEN question answering is requested THEN it SHALL use the existing question answering functionality
4. WHEN any existing feature is used THEN the user experience SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want AURA to handle errors gracefully during conversational and deferred interactions, so that failures don't leave the system in an unusable state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs during intent recognition THEN the system SHALL log the error and fall back to GUI interaction mode
2. WHEN errors occur during conversational queries THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error feedback and return to ready state
3. WHEN deferred actions fail THEN the system SHALL reset all state variables and provide audio feedback about the failure
4. WHEN the mouse listener encounters errors THEN it SHALL be properly stopped and cleaned up

### Requirement 10: Audio Feedback Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want appropriate audio feedback during conversational and deferred interactions, so that I understand what AURA is doing and when actions complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversational responses are generated THEN AURA SHALL speak the response using the existing audio system
2. WHEN deferred actions are ready for user input THEN AURA SHALL provide clear spoken instructions
3. WHEN deferred actions complete successfully THEN the system SHALL play a success sound
4. WHEN any operation fails THEN the system SHALL play a failure sound
