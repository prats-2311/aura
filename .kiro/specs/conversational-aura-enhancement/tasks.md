- [x] 5. Implement deferred action workflow system

  - Create \_handle_deferred_action_request method that initiates multi-step workflows
  - Implement content generation phase using reasoning module with code generation prompts
  - Add state management for pending actions including payload storage and action type tracking
  - Implement user instruction delivery through audio feedback system
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 10.2_

- [x] 6. Integrate global mouse listener for deferred action completion

  - Initialize and start GlobalMouseListener when deferred actions are initiated

  - Implement proper mouse listener cleanup and resource management
  - Add state validation and consistency checking throughout the workflow
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 6.4_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery

  - Implement error handling for all new interaction modes with appropriate fallback strategies
  - Add graceful state reset on errors during deferred actions with audio feedback
  - Implement timeout handling for deferred actions that exceed maximum wait time
  - Add error logging and user feedback for all failure scenarios
  - _Requirements: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 10.3, 10.4_

- [ ] 9. Create GUI interaction handler to preserve existing functionality

  - Implement \_handle_gui_interaction method that wraps existing command processing logic
  - Migrate existing regex-based command classification to the new GUI handler
