# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AURA Click Debugging Enhancement addresses persistent issues where the accessibility fast path consistently fails to detect GUI elements, causing all commands to fall back to the slower vision-based workflow. Despite previous enhancements, the system shows "Enhanced role detection failed, falling back to button-only detection" and "element_not_found" errors, indicating fundamental problems with element detection and accessibility permissions. This enhancement will implement comprehensive debugging tools, improved accessibility validation, and enhanced logging to identify and resolve the root causes of fast path failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive debugging information when the fast path fails, so that I can identify exactly why element detection is not working and fix the underlying issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fast path fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the accessibility tree structure and available elements
2. WHEN element detection fails THEN the system SHALL log all accessibility attributes of nearby elements for comparison
3. WHEN fuzzy matching fails THEN the system SHALL log the exact text being compared and the similarity scores
4. WHEN role detection fails THEN the system SHALL log all available element roles in the current application
5. WHEN the system falls back to vision THEN it SHALL log the specific failure reason and attempted search parameters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to validate accessibility permissions and provide clear guidance when permissions are insufficient, so that I can resolve permission issues that prevent fast path execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate accessibility permissions and log the current permission status
2. WHEN accessibility permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide specific instructions for granting permissions
3. WHEN permission validation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to guide the user through the permission granting process
4. IF accessibility permissions are granted during runtime THEN the system SHALL detect the change and update its capabilities
5. WHEN permissions are valid THEN the system SHALL log confirmation and proceed with enhanced fast path execution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time accessibility tree inspection tools, so that I can see exactly what elements are available and how they should be targeted by commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide a method to dump the current accessibility tree structure
2. WHEN inspecting elements THEN the system SHALL show all accessibility attributes (AXTitle, AXDescription, AXValue, AXRole) for each element
3. WHEN analyzing failed commands THEN the system SHALL compare the target text against all available element texts with similarity scores
4. WHEN examining element hierarchy THEN the system SHALL show parent-child relationships and element positioning
5. WHEN debugging is active THEN the system SHALL provide interactive tools to test element detection with different parameters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect and adapt to different application accessibility implementations, so that commands work consistently across different applications and UI frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching between applications THEN the system SHALL detect the application type and adjust element detection strategies accordingly
2. WHEN encountering web applications THEN the system SHALL use web-specific accessibility detection methods
3. WHEN working with native macOS applications THEN the system SHALL use native accessibility API methods optimally
4. IF an application has non-standard accessibility implementation THEN the system SHALL attempt multiple detection strategies
5. WHEN application detection succeeds THEN the system SHALL cache the optimal detection strategy for future use

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced error reporting and recovery mechanisms, so that temporary accessibility issues don't cause permanent fast path failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessibility API calls fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff before falling back to vision
2. WHEN element detection times out THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics and attempt faster detection methods
3. WHEN fuzzy matching produces low confidence scores THEN the system SHALL try alternative matching strategies
4. IF the accessibility tree is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL wait and retry before giving up
5. WHEN recovery attempts succeed THEN the system SHALL log the successful recovery method for future optimization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable debugging levels and output formats, so that I can control the amount of debugging information based on the troubleshooting needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging is configured THEN the system SHALL support multiple debug levels (BASIC, DETAILED, VERBOSE)
2. WHEN BASIC debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log only essential failure information and timing
3. WHEN DETAILED debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log element attributes, search parameters, and match scores
4. WHEN VERBOSE debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log complete accessibility tree dumps and all API interactions
5. WHEN debugging output is generated THEN it SHALL be formatted for easy analysis and include timestamps and context

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to provide real-time feedback about fast path performance and success rates, so that I can understand when the system is working optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL track and report fast path success rates over time
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert about declining fast path effectiveness
3. WHEN the system is working well THEN it SHALL confirm fast path success and execution times
4. IF success rates drop below 50% THEN the system SHALL suggest running diagnostic tools
5. WHEN performance improves THEN the system SHALL log the factors that contributed to the improvement

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated diagnostic tools that can identify common accessibility issues, so that I can quickly resolve configuration and permission problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN diagnostic mode is activated THEN the system SHALL run a comprehensive accessibility health check
2. WHEN checking accessibility health THEN the system SHALL verify permissions, API availability, and element detection capabilities
3. WHEN problems are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps and commands
4. IF multiple issues exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize them by impact on fast path performance
5. WHEN diagnostics complete THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report with actionable recommendations
