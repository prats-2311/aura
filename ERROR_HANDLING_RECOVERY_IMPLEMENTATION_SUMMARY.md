# Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms for the hybrid architecture's fast path functionality. This implementation addresses Requirements 3.6, 2.1, 2.2, and 6.1 from the hybrid architecture specification.

## Task 6.1: Accessibility-Specific Error Handling ✅

### Custom Exception Classes

Enhanced the accessibility module with comprehensive custom exception classes:

1. **AccessibilityPermissionError**

   - Enhanced with recovery suggestions
   - Provides specific guidance for permission issues
   - Default suggestion: Grant accessibility permissions in System Preferences

2. **AccessibilityAPIUnavailableError**

   - Enhanced with recovery suggestions
   - Provides installation guidance for missing frameworks
   - Default suggestion: Install pyobjc frameworks

3. **ElementNotFoundError**

   - Enhanced with element context (role and label)
   - Helps with debugging element detection issues

4. **New Exception Classes Added**:
   - `AccessibilityTimeoutError` - For operation timeouts
   - `AccessibilityTreeTraversalError` - For tree traversal failures
   - `AccessibilityCoordinateError` - For coordinate calculation failures

### Error Recovery Logic

Implemented comprehensive error recovery in `AccessibilityModule`:

1. **Degraded Mode Management**

   - Automatic entry into degraded mode on API failures
   - Graceful handling of permission and availability issues
   - State tracking for recovery attempts

2. **Recovery Mechanisms**

   - Automatic recovery attempts with exponential backoff
   - Configurable retry limits and timing
   - Recovery state management and diagnostics

3. **Error Handling Methods**
   - `_attempt_recovery()` - Attempts to restore functionality
   - `_should_attempt_recovery()` - Determines recovery eligibility
   - `_handle_accessibility_error()` - Centralized error processing
   - `_enter_degraded_mode()` - Manages degraded state entry

### Graceful Degradation

1. **API Initialization**

   - Handles missing frameworks gracefully
   - Continues operation in degraded mode when possible
   - Provides detailed status and diagnostic information

2. **Enhanced Status Reporting**
   - `get_accessibility_status()` - Comprehensive status information
   - `get_error_diagnostics()` - Detailed diagnostic data
   - Recovery state and timing information

## Task 6.2: Fast Path Failure Recovery ✅

### Automatic Fallback Triggering

Enhanced the orchestrator with intelligent fallback mechanisms:

1. **Enhanced Fast Path Execution**

   - Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Intelligent error classification for retry decisions
   - Detailed failure result creation and logging

2. **Fallback Handler**
   - `_handle_fast_path_fallback()` - Centralized fallback management
   - Comprehensive logging and diagnostics collection
   - Appropriate user feedback based on failure type

### Retry Logic for Transient Errors

1. **Smart Retry Logic**

   - `_should_retry_fast_path_error()` - Determines retry eligibility
   - Different retry strategies for different error types
   - Respects maximum retry limits

2. **Retryable vs Non-Retryable Errors**
   - **Retryable**: Timeout errors, tree traversal errors, connection errors
   - **Non-Retryable**: Permission errors, API unavailable, element not found
   - **Single Retry**: Unknown errors get one retry attempt

### Comprehensive Logging and Diagnostics

1. **Failure Result Creation**

   - `_create_fast_path_failure_result()` - Standardized failure reporting
   - Detailed context and diagnostic information
   - Performance metrics for failure analysis

2. **Fallback Categorization**

   - `_categorize_fallback_reason()` - Groups failures for analysis
   - Categories: element_detection, accessibility_issue, configuration, etc.
   - Enables targeted improvements and monitoring

3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Detailed failure reasons and context
   - Accessibility diagnostics during fallback
   - Performance metrics for both success and failure cases

## Key Features Implemented

### Error Recovery State Management

- Tracks error counts and recovery attempts
- Implements timing constraints for recovery attempts
- Provides comprehensive diagnostic information

### Intelligent Retry Logic

- Differentiates between transient and permanent errors
- Uses exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Respects maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops

### Comprehensive Diagnostics

- Detailed error context and failure reasons
- Accessibility API status and diagnostic information
- Performance metrics for analysis and optimization

### Graceful Degradation

- Continues operation when accessibility API is unavailable
- Provides appropriate user feedback for different failure types
- Maintains system stability during error conditions

## Testing and Verification
