- **Response time tracking**: Average, min, max response times
- **Target compliance monitoring**: 5-second target achievement rates
- **Application breakdown**: Per-application performance statistics
- **Extraction method analysis**: Performance by extraction type

#### Performance Trends Analysis

```python
def _analyze_performance_trends(self, metrics: list) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

- **Trend detection**: Improving, degrading, or stable performance
- **Confidence scoring**: Statistical confidence in trend analysis
- **Time-based comparison**: Recent vs historical performance
- **Success rate trends**: Quality improvement/degradation tracking

#### System Impact Logging

```python
def log_system_performance_impact(self) -> None
```

- **Comprehensive reporting**: 60-minute performance summaries
- **Time savings calculation**: Estimated time saved vs vision fallback
- **Usage statistics**: Fast path adoption rates
- **Application-specific insights**: Per-app performance breakdown
- **Fallback analysis**: Top reasons for fallback usage

### 5. Performance Recommendations

#### Intelligent Recommendations System

```python
def get_performance_recommendations(self) -> List[str]
```

- **Success rate analysis**: Recommendations for low success rates
- **Response time optimization**: Suggestions for slow performance
- **Target compliance**: Advice for meeting 5-second targets
- **Health-based recommendations**: Actions for degraded system health
- **Trend-based insights**: Proactive recommendations based on trends

#### Recommendation Categories

- **Application detection improvements**: Better app compatibility
- **Content extraction optimization**: Faster extraction methods
- **Timeout adjustments**: Performance threshold tuning
