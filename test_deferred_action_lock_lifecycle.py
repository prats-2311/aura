"""
Deferred Action Lock Lifecycle Test

This test specifically verifies the lock management during deferred actions:
1. Command starts -> acquires execution lock
2. Enters deferred action -> releases execution lock early (for concurrency)
3. User clicks -> re-acquires execution lock for typing
4. Typing completes -> releases execution lock
5. Deferred action completes -> releases deferred action lock
