- `RollingAverageCalculator`: Efficient rolling average calculation with trend detection
- `FastPathPerformanceMonitor`: Main monitoring class with comprehensive tracking

**Alert Types:**

- Success rate warnings (< 70%) and critical alerts (< 50%)
- Execution time warnings (> 2s) and critical alerts (> 5s)
- Performance degradation trend detection
- Application-specific consecutive failure alerts
- Performance improvement notifications

### 2. Performance Reporting System (`modules/performance_reporting_system.py`)

**Core Features:**

- Real-time feedback about fast path effectiveness
- Performance improvement/degradation detection
- Comprehensive performance reports with trends and recommendations
- Multiple export formats (JSON, HTML, Text)
- Health score calculation (0-100 scale)
- Actionable recommendations based on performance analysis

**Key Classes:**

- `PerformanceReport`: Comprehensive report data structure
- `FeedbackMessage`: Real-time feedback message structure
- `PerformanceImprovementDetector`: Analyzes performance changes and identifies factors
- `PerformanceReportingSystem`: Main reporting and feedback system

**Feedback Levels:**

- Excellent (≥90% success rate): Positive confirmation
- Good (≥75% success rate): Encouraging feedback
- Fair (≥60% success rate): Optimization suggestions
- Poor (≥40% success rate): Action required warnings
- Critical (<40% success rate): Immediate action alerts

## Requirements Compliance

### ✅ Requirement 7.1 (Success Rate Tracking)

- **WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL track and report fast path success rates over time**
  - Implemented rolling average calculation for success rates
  - Real-time tracking with configurable time windows

- **WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert about declining fast path effectiveness**
  - Automated degradation detection using trend analysis
  - Configurable thresholds for warnings and critical alerts
  - Alert cooldown system to prevent spam

### ✅ Requirement 7.4 (Diagnostic Suggestions)

- **IF success rates drop below 50% THEN the system SHALL suggest running diagnostic tools**
  - Implemented `should_suggest_diagnostics()` method
  - Automatic diagnostic recommendations in feedback messages
  - Critical performance alerts trigger diagnostic suggestions

### ✅ Requirement 7.3 (Real-time Feedback)

- **WHEN the system is working well THEN it SHALL confirm fast path success and execution times**
  - Real-time feedback generation with performance level classification
  - Positive confirmation messages for good performance
  - Detailed performance statistics in feedback

### ✅ Requirement 7.5 (Improvement Factor Logging)

- **WHEN performance improves THEN the system SHALL log the factors that contributed to the improvement**
  - Performance improvement detection with factor analysis
  - Identification of contributing factors (faster detection, better app compatibility, etc.)
  - Improvement tracking in performance reports

## Key Features

### Real-time Performance Tracking

- Alert cooldown to prevent notification spam
- Context-aware recommendations for each alert type
- Application-specific failure pattern detection

### Comprehensive Reporting

- Detailed performance reports with health scores
- Trend analysis with confidence metrics
- Export capabilities (JSON, HTML, Text formats)
- Historical performance tracking

### Performance Feedback

- Real-time user feedback based on current performance
- Actionable recommendations for performance issues
- Positive reinforcement for good performance
- Diagnostic suggestions when needed

## Testing

- 21 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality
- Thread safety testing
- Alert triggering and cooldown verification
- Rolling average calculation accuracy
- Performance statistics generation

### Integration Tests (`tests/test_performance_reporting_system.py`)

- 15 integration test cases for reporting system
- End-to-end feedback generation testing
- Report generation and export functionality
- Error handling and edge case coverage

### Demo Script (`demo_performance_monitoring.py`)

- Complete demonstration of monitoring system
- Simulated performance scenarios
- Real-time feedback and reporting examples
- Export functionality demonstration

## Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Data Structures

- Deque-based storage with automatic size limits
- Rolling average calculations without full data iteration
- Optimized alert checking (every 10th metric vs every metric)

### Thread Safety

- Thread-safe metric recording and statistics calculation
- Lock-based protection for shared data structures
- Concurrent access support for multi-threaded environments

### Memory Management

- Configurable maximum metrics storage (default: 1000)
- Automatic cleanup of old data
- Efficient data structures to minimize memory usage

## Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring

```python
from modules.fast_path_performance_monitor import FastPathPerformanceMonitor, FastPathMetric

monitor = FastPathPerformanceMonitor()

# Record execution
metric = FastPathMetric(
    command="click on button",
    app_name="Chrome",
    execution_time=0.5,
    success=True
)
monitor.record_fast_path_execution(metric)

# Get statistics
stats = monitor.get_performance_statistics()
print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate_percent']:.1f}%")
```

### Real-time Feedback

```python
from modules.performance_reporting_system import PerformanceReportingSystem

reporting_system = PerformanceReportingSystem()

# Generate feedback
feedback = reporting_system.generate_real_time_feedback()
print(f"{feedback.title}: {feedback.message}")
```

### Performance Reports

```python
# Generate comprehensive report
report = reporting_system.generate_performance_summary_report(time_period_hours=24)

# Export in different formats
json_report = reporting_system.export_performance_report(report, format='json')
html_report = reporting_system.export_performance_report(report, format='html')
```
