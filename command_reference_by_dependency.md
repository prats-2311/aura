## üö® What Happens When LM Studio is Down?

### Graceful Degradation Examples:

#### User Command: "click on the sign in button"

**AURA Response:**

```
"I can't see your screen right now because my vision system is unavailable.
Here are some alternatives:

1. Use keyboard navigation: 'press tab' to move between elements, then 'press enter'
2. If you know the location: 'click at coordinates X, Y'
3. Try a keyboard shortcut if this is a login form: 'press enter' might work
4. Tell me more specifically where it is: 'click in the top right corner'"
```

#### User Command: "fill out the form"

**AURA Response:**

```
"I can't analyze the form visually right now. Try these approaches:

1. Navigate with keyboard: 'press tab' to move between fields
2. Enter data directly: 'type your-email@domain.com' then 'press tab'
3. Use common shortcuts: 'press enter' to submit when ready
4. Tell me about the form structure and I can guide you through it"
```

#### User Command: "what's on my screen?"

**AURA Response:**

```
"My vision system is currently unavailable, so I can't see your screen.
I can still help you with:

1. Keyboard shortcuts and navigation
2. Typing specific text
3. Using coordinates if you can provide them
4. General computer tasks that don't require vision

Would you like help with any of these alternatives?"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Commands by Dependency

### When LM Studio is Working:

```

### When LM Studio is Down:
